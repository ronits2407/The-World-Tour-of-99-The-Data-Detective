# **Findings Report: Lead Singer's Scribbles Analysis**

This report summarizes the data-driven verification of the hypotheses found in the "Lead Singer's Scribbles".

### **1. Tuesday Shows are "Cursed"**

* **Scribble Hypothesis:** Tuesdays always have the lowest energy scores; things always go wrong on Tuesdays.
* **Data Analysis:**
* The notebook analyzed the average "Crowd Energy" by "Day of Week".
* The bar chart visualization showed **no significant drop** in crowd energy on Tuesdays compared to other weekdays.
* While weekends showed a slight upward trend, the data directly contradicts the idea that Tuesday shows are uniquely "cursed" or have the lowest energy.


* **Finding:** **False.** The data does not support the claim that Tuesdays are cursed or have significantly lower energy.

### **2. The "Monk" Venue Noise Limit**

* **Scribble Hypothesis:** One venue (likely with monks) has a strict noise limit where volume above a certain level kills the energy.
* **Data Analysis:**
* Analysis of volume levels by venue identified **V_Alpha** as the venue with a distinct "ceiling" on volume (volume levels rarely exceeded 7.5).
* At V_Alpha, higher volumes did not correlate with higher energy, supporting the idea of a limit.


* **Finding:** **True.** V_Alpha appears to be the "Monk" venue with a strict noise limit.

### **3. Crowd Size vs. Volume at V_Delta**

* **Scribble Hypothesis:** The singer recalled a "pricing thing" at V_Delta and wondered if "Loud = Better" there, or if it depends on crowd size.
* **Data Analysis:**
* The notebook confirms a positive correlation at **V_Delta**: Higher volume levels generally led to higher crowd energy.
* This effect was particularly strong when the crowd size was larger.


* **Finding:** **True.** At V_Delta, louder volume correlates with better crowd energy, especially with larger crowds.

### **4. "Price Sensitivity" at V_Gamma**

* **Scribble Hypothesis:** There is a specific "pricing thing" at V_Delta or V_Gamma; questioning who cares about price (snobs vs. everyone).
* **Data Analysis:**
* The analysis identified **V_Gamma** as the venue with significant price sensitivity.
* The data showed that at V_Gamma, *increasing* the ticket price actually correlated with *increased* crowd energy, whereas very low prices resulted in lower energy.
* For other venues, prices between $30-$70 generally worked best without such a strong sensitivity.


* **Finding:** **True (for V_Gamma).** V_Gamma is the venue with distinct price sensitivity, where higher prices (likely implying a more "exclusive" or "snob" audience) lead to better energy.

### **5. "Goth" Venue Timing**

* **Scribble Hypothesis:** Timing matters for "goths" (implied to be a specific venue like V_Beta), or perhaps every venue has timing preferences.
* **Data Analysis:**
* The notebook analyzed crowd energy by hour for each venue.
* **V_Beta** showed a clear preference for late-night shows, with energy scores being significantly higher for shows starting late at night compared to earlier times.


* **Finding:** **True.** V_Beta fits the profile of the "Goth" venue where late-night timing is crucial for high energy.

### **6. Weather Affects Energy**

* **Scribble Hypothesis:** Rain "sucks" and might affect energy, or it might just be the singer's mood.
* **Data Analysis:**
* The notebook tested weather impacts and found that **Stormy** weather does indeed correlate with lower energy scores across the board.(Specially for **V_Delta & V_Beta**)


* **Finding:** **True.** Weather (specifically storm) has a negative impact on crowd energy, confirming it's not just the singer's mood.

### **7. "Sock Color" & "Opener" Importance**

* **Scribble Hypothesis:** The singer dismisses sock color as irrelevant but questions if the "Opener" actually matters.
* **Data Analysis:**
* The notebook found a strong correlation between **Opener Rating** and **Crowd Energy**  only at **V_Gamma**. A better opener rating consistently led to higher crowd energy for the main act.


* **Finding:** **True.** The Opener matters significantly only for **V_Gamma**. (Sock color was not analyzed but presumed irrelevant as per the notes).

### **8. "Moon Phase"**

* **Scribble Hypothesis:** "Moon phase is real" vs. the drummer saying it's crazy.
* **Data Analysis:**
* The notebook plotted crowd energy against moon phases.
* The visualization showed **no significant correlation** between moon phase and crowd energy.


* **Finding:** **False.** The drummer was right; moon phase has zero correlation with crowd energy.

### **9. "Month"**


* **Data Analysis:**
* The notebook plotted crowd energy against Months.
* The visualization showed **highter response** for  months **March-October** for 
all venues **except  V_Beta**.
